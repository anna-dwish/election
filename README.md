# Overview

In this project, we hope to predict the results for the following 2020 U.S. elections: (1) the outcome of the presidential election, (2) whether the US Senate remains in Republican control, (3) the electoral college vote, (4) the outcomes of all NC Congressional elections (the 13 federal Representatives to Congress), and (5) the outcome of the NC Senate election, including characterization of uncertainty in predictions.

# Methods Summary

We chose to use a Bayesian approach for creating our election models.
